# Prediction-of-electricity-generation
We combine the characteristics of linear and nonlinear models, making a prediction and comparison of Indian power generation. In this way, we enrich methods for prediction research on electrical energy, which avoids large errors in trends of electricity generation due to those accidental factors when a single predictive model is used.
